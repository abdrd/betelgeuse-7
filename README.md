Hello. <br><br>
I am a software developer from Turkey. I've started programming in September, 2020. As a software developer, I would like to work on microservices
in the future. I mainly use Go, though, I am learning C to build other projects with.

I am interested in programming languages, compilers, and back-end web technologies. I am currently building a small transpiler
in an attempt to learn about scanners, parsers, and type-checkers. I've set up some goals for this year (2023), and they are 
as follows:

- Study computers:
  - First, study computer systems using the book "Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective", and the accompanying course 
    from Carnegie Mellon University called CS-213: Introduction to Computer Systems.
  - Study operating systems using -probably- the book "Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces" freely available online.
  - Study networking, and distributed systems.

- Build projects:
  - An emulator for a NES, or Game Boy
  - A compiler for a more well-designed -compared to the toy language I am building a transpiler for- programming language.
    The language will have a garbage collector, so I will learn about implementing one. That compiler will, at first, produce
    -x86-64 assembly. I will link the final executable with a libc implementation statically. I think the executables will only
    run on Linux systems at first (no Windows initially (maybe never)).
  - A project consisting of various microservices cooperating to provide some service (probably including binary files). 
    This will be written in Go, and using many external services such as database servers, cache servers, message queues, etc.
