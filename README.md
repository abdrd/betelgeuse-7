Hello. <br><br>
I am a software developer from Turkiye. I've started programming in September, 2020. I mainly use Go.

I am interested in programming languages, compilers, and back-end web technologies.

My current project now is a compiler for a general-purpose statically-typed garbage-collected language with pattern matching and generic programming.
